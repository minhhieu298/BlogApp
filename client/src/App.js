          Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector
          to another. In our example we're going to create a simple series of
          messaging for errors, warnings and successes using another feature
          which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder classes. A
          placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it
          is extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.
